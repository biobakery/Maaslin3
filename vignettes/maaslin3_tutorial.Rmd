## Introduction ##

**MaAsLin 3** is the next generation of **M**a**A**s**L**in (**M**icrobiome **M**ultivariable **A**ssociation with **L**inear Models).

[**MaAsLin3**](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/MaAsLin3) is comprehensive R package for efficiently determining multivariable associations between clinical metadata and microbial meta-omics features. Relative to MaAsLin 2, MaAsLin 3 introduces the ability to quantify and test for **both abundance and prevalence associations** while **accounting for compositionality**. MaAsLin3 relies on general linear models to accommodate most modern epidemiological study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal, along with a variety of filtering, normalization, and transform methods.

If you use the MaAsLin 3 software, please cite our manuscript:

## 1. Installing R  

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language specializing in 
statistical computing and graphics. You can use R just the same as any other 
programming languages, but it is most useful for statistical analyses, with 
well-established packages for common tasks such as [linear modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html), ['omic 
data analysis](https://bioconductor.org/), [machine learning](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html), and [visualization](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). We have created a short introduction tutorial [here](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/Introduction-to-R#1-lab-setup-and-basics-in-r), but we note there are many other more comprehensive tutorials out there to learn R. 

#### Installing R for the first time

You can download and install the free R software environment 
[here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Note that you should download the latest
release - this will ensure the R version you have is compatible with MaAsLin 3.

#### (Optional) the RStudio IDE

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a freely available 
IDE (integrated development environment) for R. It is a "wrapper" around R with
some additional functionalities that makes programming in R a bit easier. Feel 
free to download RStudio and explore its interface - but it is not required 
for this tutorial.

#### Important: the correct R version

If you already have R installed, then it is possible that the R version you have 
does not support MaAsLin 3. The easiest way to check this is to launch R/RStudio,
and in the console ("Console" pane in RStudio), type in the following command 
(without the `>` symbol):

```{R, eval=F}
sessionInfo()
```

The first line of output message should indicate your current R version. For 
example:

```
> sessionInfo()
R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)
```

For MaAsLin 3 to install, you will need R >= 4.3. If your version is older than
that, please refer to section 
[Installing R for the first time](#installing-r-for-the-first-time) to download 
the latest R. Note that
RStudio users will need to have RStudio "switch" to this later version once it 
is installed. This should happen automatically for Windows and Mac OS users when
you relaunch RStudio. For Linux users you might need to bind the correct R 
executable. For more information refer to [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486138-Changing-R-versions-for-RStudio-desktop). Either way, once you have the correct version installed, launch 
the software and use `sessionInfo()` to make sure that you indeed have R >= 4.3.

## 2. Installing MaAsLin 3

The latest development version of MaAsLin 3 can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require('devtools', character.only = TRUE)) {
  install.packages('devtools')
}

library("devtools")
install_github("biobakery/MaAsLin3")
```

```{r, eval=T}
for (lib in c('maaslin3', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'knitr', 'kableExtra')) {
    suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(lib, character.only = TRUE))
}
```

## 3. Microbiome Association Detection with MaAsLin 3

To run MaAsLin 3, a user inputs a table of per-sample feature abundances (with zeros still included), a table of per-sample metadata, and a model specifying how the metadata should relate to the feature presence/absence and abundance. MaAsLin 3 will return a table of associations including an effect size and p-value for each feature-metadatum association and a folder of visuals including a summary plot and diagnostic plots for significant associations.

### 3.1 MaAsLin 3 Input

MaAsLin3 requires two input files.

1. Feature abundance data frame
    * Formatted with features as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transpose of this format is also okay.
    * Possible features in this file include taxonomy or genes. These can be relative abundances or counts.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.
2. Metadata data frame
    * Formatted with variables as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transpose of this format is also okay.
    * Possible metadata in this file include gender or age.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.

The data file can contain samples not included in the metadata file
(along with the reverse case). For both cases, those samples not 
included in both files will be removed from the analysis. 
Also the samples do not need to be in the same order in the two files.

Example input files can be found in the ``inst/extdata`` folder 
of the MaAsLin 3 source. The files provided were generated from
the HMP2 data which can be downloaded from https://ibdmdb.org/ .

```{R}   
# Read abundance table
taxa_table_name <- system.file("extdata", "HMP2_taxonomy.tsv", package = "maaslin3")
taxa_table <- read.csv(taxa_table_name, sep = '\t')

# Read metadata table
metadata_name <- system.file("extdata", "HMP2_metadata.tsv", package = "maaslin3")
metadata <- read.csv(metadata_name, sep = '\t')

# Factor the categorical variables to test against controls
metadata$diagnosis <- 
  factor(metadata$diagnosis, levels = c('nonIBD', 'UC', 'CD'))
metadata$dysbiosis_state <- 
  factor(metadata$dysbiosis_state, levels = c('none', 'dysbiosis_UC', 'dysbiosis_CD'))
metadata$antibiotics <- 
  factor(metadata$antibiotics, levels = c('No', 'Yes'))

taxa_table[1:5, 1:5]
metadata[1:5, 1:5]
```

``HMP2_taxonomy.tsv``: is a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and 
species as columns. It is a subset of the taxonomy file that includes just some of the the 
species abundances.

``HMP2_metadata.tsv``: is a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and metadata 
as columns. It is a subset of the metadata file that includes just some of 
the fields.

### 3.2 Running MaAsLin 3

MaAsLin 3 is run by specifying a `param_list` that contains the abundance table (`input_data`), the metadata table (`input_metadata`), the output directory (`output`), and a model specification. The model specification can come from a formula or vectors of terms. In either case, variable names should not have spaces or unusual characters.

* *Formula*: The `formula` parameter should be set to any formula that satisfies the `lme4` specifications: fixed effects, interaction terms, random effects, polynomial terms, and more can all be included. In addition, group and ordered predictors (see below) can be included by including `group(variable_name)` and `ordered(variable_name)` in the formula.
* *Vectors*: Alternatively, a vector of variables can be supplied to the parameters `fixed_effects`, `random_effects`, `group_effects`, and `ordered_effects`. Categorical variables should either be ordered as factors beforehand, or `reference` should be provided as a string of 'variable,reference' semi-colon delimited for multiple variables (e.g., `variable_1,reference_1;variable_2,reference_2`). NOTE: adding a space between the variable and level might result in the wrong reference level being used.

**Because MaAsLin 3 considers prevalence associations, read depth (number of reads) should be included as a covariate if available since deeper sequencing will likely increase feature detection in a way that could spuriously correlate with metadata of interest.**

#### Running MaAsLin 3 on HMP2 data

The following command runs MaAsLin 3 on the HMP2 data, running a multivariable
regression model to test for the association between microbial species abundance and prevalence
versus IBD diagnosis and [dysbiosis scores](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1237-9) while controlling for antibiotic usage, age, and the sampling depth (reads). Outputs are generated in a folder called `demo_output` under the current working directory (`output = "demo_output"`).

To show one of each type of plot (see below), the maximum number of significant associations to plot has been increased with `max_pngs=100`. All other parameters beyond the first four are the default parameters but are still included for clarity. By default, total sum scaling with a log transformation afterwards will be used. However, other normalizations and transformations are allowed (see `normalization` and `transform` in the manual). Also by default, a data augmentation procedure is used to avoid linear separability in the logistic regressions. This is almost always recommended, though it can be turned off (see `augment` in the manual). A nominal FDR level of 0.1 determines which associations are significant, but this can also be changed (see `max_significance` in the manual). For the abundance coefficients, to account for compositionality in relative abundance data, significance is determined by comparing against the median coefficient for a metadatum across the features (`median_comparison_abundance`). Since prevalence coefficients do not have the same compositional properties, they are instead compared against 0 (`median_comparison_prevalence`). See the manual for a discussion of when to change these parameters. One CPU is used for fitting (`cores = 1`).

```{R, echo = T, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
param_list <- list(input_data = taxa_table, 
                   input_metadata = metadata, 
                   output = 'demo_output', 
                   formula = '~ diagnosis + dysbiosis_state + antibiotics + age + reads',
                   normalization = 'TSS', 
                   transform = 'LOG', 
                   augment = TRUE, 
                   max_significance = 0.1, 
                   median_comparison_abundance = TRUE, 
                   median_comparison_prevalence = FALSE, 
                   max_pngs = 100,
                   cores = 1)

fit_out <- maaslin3(param_list)
```

#### Median comparisons

When `median_comparison_abundance` or `median_comparison_prevalence` are on, the coefficients for a metadatum will be tested against the median coefficient for that metadatum (median across the features). Otherwise, the coefficients will be tested against 0. For abundance associations, this is designed to account for compositionality, the idea that if only one feature has a positive association with a metadatum on the absolute scale, the other features will have apparent negative associations with that metadatum on the relative scale because relative abundances must sum to 1. More generally, associations on the relative scale are not necessarily the same as the associations on the absolute scale in magnitude or sign, so testing against zero on the relative scale is not equivalent to testing against zero on absolute scale. However, the median comparison enables some inference on the absolute scale. There are two interpretations of this test for absolute abundance associations:

1. In linear models, if two features' associations with a particular metadatum on the log absolute scale differ by some value $d$, the features' associations with that metadatum on the log relative scale (total-sum scaling) will also differ by $d$. Therefore, the test against the median can always be interpreted as a test of whether a particular association is significantly different from the typical association on the absolute scale. (Or, equivalently because of the 1-1 relation, this tests whether a particular association is significantly different from the typical association on the relative scale).
2. Under the assumption that at least half the features are not changing on the absolute scale, the median true absolute coefficient is 0, so this can be interpreted as a test of whether the feature has a non-zero association on the absolute scale

By contrast, sparsity should be less affected by compositionality since a feature should still be present even if another increases or decreases in abundance. (However, because the read depth is finite, this might not perfectly hold.) Therefore, `median_comparison_prevalence` is off by default, but it can be turned on if the user is interested in testing whether a particular prevalence association is significantly different from the typical prevalence association.

In both cases, if the tested coefficient is within `median_comparison_[abundance/prevalence]_threshold` of the median, it will automatically receive a p-value of 1. This is based on the idea that the association might be statistically significantly different but not substantially different from the median and therefore is likely still a compositional effect.

To conclude:

* `median_comparison_abundance` is `TRUE` by default and should be used to make inference on the absolute scale when using relative abundance data.
* `median_comparison_abundance` should be `FALSE` when (1) testing for significant relative associations, (2) testing for absolute abundance associations under the assumption that the total absolute abundance is not changing, or (3) testing for significant absolute associations when supplying spike-in or total abundances with `unscaled_abundance`.
* `median_comparison_prevalence` is `FALSE` by default since most analysis focuses on whether a prevalence association is non-zero, not whether it is significantly different from the typical prevalence association.

### 3.3 MaAsLin 3 Output

#### Significant associations

The main output from MaAsLin 3 is the list of significant associations in `significant_results.tsv`. This lists all associations that pass MaAsLin 3's significance 
threshold, ordered by increasing joint q-value. The format is:

  * Columns 1 and 2 are the feature and metadata names.
  * Columns 3 and 4 are the value of the metadata and variable name from the model.
  * Columns 5 and 6 are the fit coefficient and standard error from the model.
  * Columns 7 and 8 are the p-value and FDR corrected q-value of the individual association.
  * Column 9 species whether the association is abundance or prevalence.
  * Column 10 is the total number of data points.
  * Column 11 is the total number of non-zero data points.
  * Columns 12 and 13 are the p-value and q-value of the joint prevalence and abundance association.
  
```{r, echo = F}
signif_results <- read.csv('demo_output/significant_results.tsv', sep='\t')
signif_results %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.numeric, .funs = function(x){(as.character(signif(x, 3)))}) %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", position = 'center') %>% 
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "400px")
```

  
#### Full output file structure

MaAsLin 3 generates two types of output files: data and visualization.

1. Data output files
    * ``significant_results.tsv``
        * Described above.
    * ``all_results.tsv``
        * Same format as above but for all associations and with an extra column listing any errors from the model fitting.
    * ``features``
        * This folder includes the filtered, normalized, and transformed versions of the input feature table.
        * These steps are performed sequentially in the above order.
        * If an option is set such that a step does not change the data, the resulting table will still be output.
    * ``models_LM.rds`` and ``models_logistic.rds``
        * This file contains a list with every model fit object (`LM` for linear models, `logistic` for logistic models).
        * It will only be generated if `save_models` is set to TRUE.
    * ``residuals_LM.rds`` and ``residuals_logstic.rds``
        * This file contains a data frame with residuals for each feature.
    * ``fitted_LM.rds`` and ``fitted_logistic.rds``
        * This file contains a data frame with fitted values for each feature.
    * ``ranef_LM.rds`` and ``ranef_logistic.rds``
        * This file contains a data frame with extracted random effects for each feature (when random effects are specified).
    * ``maaslin3.log``
        * This file contains all log information for the run.
        * It includes all settings, warnings, errors, and steps run.
2. Visualization output files
    * ``summary_plot.pdf``
        * This file contains a combined coefficient plot and heatmap of the most significant associations. In the heatmap, one star indicates the individual q-value is below the parameter `max_significance`, and two stars indicate the individual q-value is below `max_significance` divided by 10.
```{r, out.width='100%', echo=F}
# Rename summary plot to avoid knitting issues later
file.rename('demo_output/figures/summary_plot.png', 
            'demo_output/figures/summary_plot_first.png')

knitr::include_graphics("demo_output/figures/summary_plot_first.png")
```
    * ``association_plots/[metadatum]_[feature]_[association].pdf``
        * A plot is generated for each significant association up to `max_pngs`.
        * Scatter plots are used for continuous metadata abundance associations.
        * Box plots are used for categorical data abundance associations.
        * Box plots are used for continuous data prevalence associations.
        * Grids are used for categorical data prevalence associations.
        * Data points plotted are after filtering, normalization, and transformation so that the scale in the plot is the scale that was used in fitting.
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="20%",fig.cap="The four types of association plots",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("demo_output/figures/association_plots/age_Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_LM.png",
                          "demo_output/figures/association_plots/dysbiosis_state_Escherichia_coli_LM.png",
                          "demo_output/figures/association_plots/age_Bifidobacterium_longum_logistic.png",
                          "demo_output/figures/association_plots/dysbiosis_state_Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii_logistic.png"))
```

At the top right of each association plot is the name of the significant association in the results file, the FDR corrected q-value for the individual association, the number of samples in the dataset, and the number of samples with non-zero abundances for the feature. In the plots with categorical metadata variables, the reference category is on the left, and the significant q-values and coefficients in the top right are in the order of the values specified above. Because the displayed coefficients correspond to the full fit model with (possibly) scaled metadata variables, the marginal association plotted might not match the coefficient displayed. However, the plots are intended to provide an interpretable visual while usually agreeing with the full model.

#### Diagnostics

There are a few common issues to check for in the results:

1. When warnings or errors are thrown during the fitting process, they are recorded in the `error` column of `all_results.tsv`. Often, these indicate model fitting failures or poor fits that should not be trusted, but sometimes the warnings can be benign, and the model fit might still be reasonable. Users should check associations of interest if they produce errors.
2. Despite the error checking, significant results could still result from poor model fits. These can usually be diagnosed with the visuals in the `association_plots` directory. 
    * Any significant abundance associations with a categorical variable should usually have **at least 10 observations in each category**.
    * Significant categorical prevalence associations should also have **at least 10 samples in which the feature was present and at least 10 samples in which it was absent for each significant category**. 
    * Significant abundance associations with continuous metadata should be checked visually for influential outliers.
    
#### Replotting

Once `maaslin3` has been run once, `maaslin_plot_results_from_output` can be run with the same `param_list` as the original `maaslin3` run to (re-)create the plots. This allows the user to plot the associations even without having the R object returned by `maaslin_fit` or `maaslin3` (e.g., if fitting models through the command line). It is recommended to fit models with simple variables names that are robust to formula plotting and then convert these into proper names for plotting. Likewise, `heatmap_vars` and `coef_plot_vars` can be specified in the `param_list` at any point, but it is usually easier to see how the names come out at first and then choose which metadata variables will go in the coefficient plot and which will go in the heatmap afterwards with `maaslin_plot_results_from_output`.

```{R, echo = T, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}

# Recreate the plots
scatter_plots <- maaslin_plot_results_from_output(param_list)
```

In the new summary plot below, we can see that the feature names are cleaned up, the metadata names are cleaned up, the set of metadata variables used in the coefficient plot is different, and the metadata used in the heatmap is reordered.
```{r, out.width='100%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("demo_output/figures/summary_plot.png")
```

In the association plots, the taxa and metadata have been renamed to be consistent with the results file from earlier.

### 4.2 Random Effects

Certain studies have a natural "grouping" of sample observations, such
as by subject in longitudinal designs or by family in family designs. It is 
important for statistic analysis to address the non-independence between samples
belonging to the same group MaAsLin 3 provides a simple interface for this
through the parameter `random_effects`, where the user can specify the grouping
variable to run a [mixed effect model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) instead. For
example, we note that HMP2 is a longitudinal design where the same subject 
(column `subject`) can have multiple samples. We thus ask MaAsLin 3 to use
subject as its random effect grouping variable:

```R
fit_data_random = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_data, 
                           input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                           min_prevalence = 0,
                           normalization  = "NONE",
                           output         = "demo_output_random", 
                           fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis"),
                           random_effects = c("subject"),
                           reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"))
```

If you are interested in testing the effect of time in a longitudinal study,
then the time point variable should be included in `fixed_effects` during your
MaAsLin 3 call.

* Question: intuitively, can you think of a reason why it is important to 
  address non-independence between samples?
  * Hint: imagine the simple scenario where you have two subject, one case and 
    one control, each has two samples.
  * What is the effective sample size, when samples of the same subject are 
    highly independent, versus when they are highly correlated?

  * The factor to use as a reference for a variable with more than two levels provided as a string of 'variable,reference' semi-colon delimited for multiple variables.


#### 4.3.1 Prevalence and abundance filtering in MaAsLin 3

Typically, it only makes sense to test for feature-metadata associations if a feature is non-zero "enough" of the time. "Enough" can vary between studies, but a 10-50% minimum prevalence threshold is not unusual (and up to 70-90% can be reasonable). Since we're already using a small, selected subset of demo data, we'll use `min_prevalence = 0.1` to test only features with at least 10% non-zero values. **Note:** this is the default parameter setting in MaAsLin 3. 

Similarly, it's often desirable to test only features that reach a minimum abundance threshold in at least this many samples. By default, MaAsLin 3 will consider any non-zero value to be reliable, and if you've already done sufficient QC in your dataset, this is appropriate. However, if you'd like to filter more or be conservative, you can set a minimum abundance threshold like `min_abundance = 0.0001` to test only features reaching at least this (relative) abundance.

Putting these arguments together, we can run MaAsLin 3 (and it'll go even faster!) using both:

```R
fit_data_filter = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_data, 
                           input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                           normalization  = "NONE",
                           output         = "demo_output_filter", 
                           fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis"),
                           reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"),
                           random_effects = c("subject"),
                           min_prevalence = 0.1,
                           min_abundance  = 0.0001)
```


## 5. Command Line Interface

MaAsLin 3 can also be run with a command line interface. For example, the demo
analysis can be performed with:

```
Maaslin2.R --transform=AST --fixed_effects="diagnosis,dysbiosis"  /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Maaslin2/extdata/HMP2_taxonomy.tsv /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Maaslin2/extdata/HMP2_metadata.tsv demo_output --reference="diagnosis,nonIBD"
```

* Make sure to provide the full path to the MaAsLin 3 executable (ie ./R/Maaslin2.R).
* In the demo command:
    * ``HMP2_taxonomy.tsv`` is the path to your data (or features) file
    * ``HMP2_metadata.tsv`` is the path to your metadata file
    * ``demo_output`` is the path to the folder to write the output
