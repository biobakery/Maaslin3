## Introduction ##

**MaAsLin 3** is the next generation of **M**a**A**s**L**in (**M**icrobiome **M**ultivariable **A**ssociation with **L**inear Models).

[**MaAsLin3**](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/MaAsLin3) is comprehensive R package for efficiently determining multivariable association between clinical metadata and microbial meta-omics features. MaAsLin3 relies on general linear models to accommodate most modern epidemiological study designs, including cross-sectional and longitudinal, along with a variety of filtering, normalization, and transform methods.

If you use the MaAsLin 3 software, please cite our manuscript:

## 1. Installing R  

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language specializing in 
statistical computing and graphics. You can use R just the same as any other 
programming languages, but it is most useful for statistical analyses, with 
well-established packages for common tasks such as [linear modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html), ['omic 
data analysis](https://bioconductor.org/), [machine learning](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html), and [visualization](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). We have created a short introduction tutorial [here](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/Introduction-to-R#1-lab-setup-and-basics-in-r), but we note there are many other more comprehensive tutorials out there to learn R. 

#### Installing R for the first time

You can download and install the free R software environment 
[here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Note that you should download the latest
release - this will ensure the R version you have is compatible with MaAsLin 3.

#### (Optional) the RStudio IDE

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is a freely available 
IDE (integrated development environment) for R. It is a "wrapper" around R with
some additional functionalities that makes programming in R a bit easier. Feel 
free to download RStudio and explore its interface - but it is not required 
for this tutorial.

#### Important: the correct R version

If you already have R installed, then it is possible that the R version you have 
does not support MaAsLin 3. The easiest way to check this is to launch R/RStudio,
and in the console ("Console" pane in RStudio), type in the following command 
(without the `>` symbol):

```{R, eval=F}
sessionInfo()
```

The first line of output message should indicate your current R version. For 
example:

```
> sessionInfo()
R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)
```

For MaAsLin 3 to install, you will need R >= 4.3. If your version is older than
that, please refer to section 
[Installing R for the first time](#installing-r-for-the-first-time) to download 
the latest R. Note that
RStudio users will need to have RStudio "switch" to this later version once it 
is installed. This should happen automatically for Windows and Mac OS users when
you relaunch RStudio. For Linux users you might need to bind the correct R 
executable. For more information refer to [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486138-Changing-R-versions-for-RStudio-desktop). Either way, once you have the correct version installed, launch 
the software and use `sessionInfo()` to make sure that you indeed have R >= 4.3.

## 2. Installing MaAsLin 3

The latest development version of MaAsLin 3 can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require('devtools', character.only = TRUE)) {
  install.packages('devtools')
}

library("devtools")
install_github("biobakery/MaAsLin3")
```

```{r, eval=T}
library("maaslin3")
```

## 3. Microbiome Association Detection with MaAsLin 3

### 3.1 MaAsLin 3 Input

MaAsLin3 requires two input files.

1. Feature abundance data frame
    * Formatted with features as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transpose of this format is also okay.
    * Possible features in this file include taxonomy or genes. These can be relative abundances or counts.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.
2. Metadata data frame
    * Formatted with variables as columns and samples as rows.
    * The transpose of this format is also okay.
    * Possible metadata in this file include gender or age.
    * This can be a filepath to a tab-delimited file.

The data file can contain samples not included in the metadata file
(along with the reverse case). For both cases, those samples not 
included in both files will be removed from the analysis. 
Also the samples do not need to be in the same order in the two files.

Example input files can be found in the ``inst/extdata`` folder 
of the MaAsLin 3 source. The files provided were generated from
the HMP2 data which can be downloaded from https://ibdmdb.org/ .

```{R}   
# Read abundance table
taxa_table_name <- system.file("extdata", "HMP2_taxonomy.tsv", package = "maaslin3")
taxa_table <- read.csv(taxa_table_name, sep = '\t')

# Read metadata table
metadata_name <- system.file("extdata", "HMP2_metadata.tsv", package = "maaslin3")
metadata <- read.csv(metadata_name, sep = '\t')

# Factor the categorical variables to test against controls
metadata$diagnosis <- 
  factor(metadata$diagnosis, levels = c('nonIBD', 'UC', 'CD'))
metadata$dysbiosis_state <- 
  factor(metadata$dysbiosis_state, levels = c('none', 'dysbiosis_UC', 'dysbiosis_CD'))
metadata$antibiotics <- 
  factor(metadata$antibiotics, levels = c('No', 'Yes'))

taxa_table[1:5, 1:5]
metadata[1:5, 1:5]
```

``HMP2_taxonomy.tsv``: is a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and 
species as columns. It is a subset of the taxonomy file that includes just some of the the 
species abundances.

``HMP2_metadata.tsv``: is a tab-delimited file with samples as rows and metadata 
as columns. It is a subset of the metadata file that includes just some of 
the fields.

### 3.2 Running MaAsLin 3

MaAsLin 3 is run by specifying a `param_list` that contains the abundance table (`input_data`), the metadata table (`input_metadata`), the output directory (`output`), and a model specification. The model specification can come from a formula or vectors of terms. In either case, variable names should not have spaces or unusual characters.

* *Formula*: The `formula` parameter should be set to any formula that satisfies the `lme4` specifications: fixed effects, interaction terms, random effects, polynomial terms, and more can all be included. In addition, group and ordered predictors (see below) can be included by including `group(variable_name)` and `ordered(variable_name)` in the formula.
* *Vectors*: Alternatively, a vector of variables can be supplied to the parameters `fixed_effects`, `random_effects`, `group_effects`, and `ordered_effects`. Categorical variables should either be ordered as factors beforehand, or `reference` should be provided as a string of 'variable,reference' semi-colon delimited for multiple variables (e.g., `variable_1,reference_1;variable_2,reference_2`). NOTE: adding a space between the variable and level might result in the wrong reference level being used.

The following command runs MaAsLin 3 on the HMP2 data, running a multivariable
regression model to test for the association between microbial species abundance and prevalence
versus IBD diagnosis and [dysbiosis scores](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1237-9) while controlling for antibiotic usage, age, and the sampling depth (reads). Note that because MaAsLin 3 considers prevalence associations, sampling depth (read count) should be included as a covariate if available since deeper sequencing will likely increase feature detection in a way that could spuriously correlate with metadata of interest. Outputs are generated in a folder called `demo_output` under the current working directory (`output = "demo_output"`).

All parameters beyond the first four are the default parameters but are still included for clarity. By default, total sum scaling with a log transformation afterwards will be used. However, other normalizations and transformations are allowed (see `normalization` and `transform` in the manual). Also by default, a data augmentation procedure is used to avoid linear separability in the logistic regressions. This is almost always recommended, though it can be turned off (see `augment` in the manual). A nominal FDR level of 0.1 determines which associations are significant, but this can also be changed (see `max_significance` in the manual). For the abundance coefficients, to account for compositionality in relative abundance data, significance is determined by comparing against the median coefficient for a metadatum across the features (`median_comparison_abundance`). Since prevalence coefficients do not have the same compositional properties, they are instead compared against 0 (`median_comparison_prevalence`). See the manual for a discussion of when to change these parameters. One CPU is used for fitting (`cores = 1`).

```{R, echo = T, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE}
param_list <- list(input_data = taxa_table, 
                   input_metadata = metadata, 
                   output = 'demo_output', 
                   formula = '~ diagnosis + dysbiosis_state + antibiotics + age + reads',
                   normalization = 'TSS', 
                   transform = 'LOG', 
                   augment = TRUE, 
                   max_significance = 0.1, 
                   median_comparison_abundance = TRUE, 
                   median_comparison_prevalence = FALSE, 
                   cores = 1)

fit_out <- maaslin3(param_list)
```



### 3.3 MaAsLin 3 Output

#### Significant associations

Perhaps the most important output from MaAsLin 3 is the list of significant 
associations. These are provided in `significant_results.tsv`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biobakery/omnibus-and-maaslin2-rscripts-and-hmp2-data/master/assets/sigresults_screenshot.png" width="500">

These are the full list of associations that pass MaAsLin 3's significance 
threshold, ordered by increasing q-values. Columns are:

* `metadata`: the variable name being associated with a microbial feature.
* `feature`: the microbial feature (taxon, gene, pathway, etc.).
* `value`: for categorical features, the specific feature level for which the coefficient and significance of association is being reported. 
* `coef`: the model coefficient value (effect size).
  * Coefficients for categorical variables indicate the contrast between the
    category specified in `value` versus the reference category.
* `stderr`: the standard error from the model.
* `N`: the total number of samples used in the model for this association (since e.g. missing values can be excluded).
* `N.not.0`: the total of number of these samples in which the feature is non-zero.
* `pval`: the nominal significance of this association.
* `qval`: the corrected significance is computed with `p.adjust` with the correction method (BH, etc.).


* Question: how would you interpret the first row of this table?

For each of the significant associations in `significant_results.tsv`, MaAsLin 3
also generates visualizations for inspection (boxplots for categorical variables,
scatter plots for continuous). These are named as "metadata_name.pdf". For 
example, from our analysis run, we have the visualization files `dysbiosis.pdf`
and `diagnosis.pdf`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biobakery/omnibus-and-maaslin2-rscripts-and-hmp2-data/master/assets/boxplot_screenshot.png" width="500">

#### Full list of output files

MaAsLin 3 generates two types of output files: data and visualization.

1. Data output files
    * ``significant_results.tsv``
        * As introduced above.
    * ``all_results.tsv``
        * Same format as ``significant_results.tsv``, but include all 
          association results (instead of just the significant ones).
        * You can also access this table within R using `fit_data$results`.
    * ``residuals.rds``
        * This file contains a data frame with residuals for each feature.
    * ``maaslin2.log``
        * This file contains all log information for the run.
        * It includes all settings, warnings, errors, and steps run.
2. Visualization output files
    * ``heatmap.pdf``
        * This file contains a heatmap of the significant associations.
    * ``[a-z/0-9]+.pdf``
        * A plot is generated for each significant association.
        * Scatter plots are used for continuous metadata.
        * Box plots are for categorical data.
        * Data points plotted are after normalization, filtering, and transform.

### 3.4 MaAsLin 2 on functional profiles

If your functional tables have been produced by HUMAnN and been normalized with the `humann_renorm_table` script, then you don’t need to perform any additional normalization – the effects of sequencing depth will have already been removed (which is what we will be using in this tutorial). We tend to work with CPM units because we find them to be more convenient, but they are numerically equivalent to relative abundances for modeling purposes (CPM = RA * 1e6).

Otherwise - you will want to use the same thoughts above about model/normalization/transformation as above. 

Some other quick tips for using MaAsLin 3 on functional profiles:
* To reduce the number of features, you typically want to run either the unstratified functional features (or a filtered subset of the stratified features) 
* You may also want to remove functional features that are highly correlated to one specific taxon (i.e. likely contributed by that microbe), since these can be better-explained by taxonomic changes. 

```R
#This can also be done with with the HUMAnN 3 untiliy `humann_split_stratified_table`
unstrat_pathways <-function(dat_path){
  temp = dat_path[!grepl("\\|",rownames(dat_path)),]
  return(temp)
}

df_input_path = unstrat_pathways(df_input_path)
```

Run the same model as above on the MetaCyc pathway table generated from the [bioBakery workflows](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/biobakery_workflows). 

```R
fit_func = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_path, 
                    input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                    output         = "demo_functional", 
                    fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis"),
                    reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"),
                    min_abundance  = 0.0001,
                    min_prevalence = 0.1)
```

**Note:** Here we have the samples in the columns and the features in the rows and MaAsLin 3 correctly identified this and was able to match the samples. 

We have also recently published on using MaAsLin 3 to analyze differential features in metatranscriptomic data (MTX), for further information on that please see our [recent publication](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/Supplement_1/i34/6319701).

Q: Does the output of the functional run make sense? What are some of the important features to investigate further?

## 4. Advanced Topics

### 4.1 Interactions

Many statistical analysis are interested in testing for [interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)#In_regression) 
between certain variables. Unfortunately, MaAsLin 3 does not yet provide a direct 
interface for this. Instead, the user needs to create artificial interaction
columns as additional `fixed_effects` terms. Using the above fit as an example,
to test for the interaction between `diagnosis` and `dysbiosis`, I
can create two additional columns: `CD_dysbiosis` and `UC_dysbiosis` (since the 
reference for `diagnosis` is `nonIBD`):

```R
df_input_metadata$CD_dysbiosis = (df_input_metadata$diagnosis == "CD") *
                                 df_input_metadata$dysbiosis
df_input_metadata$UC_dysbiosis = (df_input_metadata$diagnosis == "UC") *
                                 df_input_metadata$dysbiosis

fit_data_ixn = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_data, 
                        input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                        min_prevalence = 0,
                        normalization  = "NONE",
                        output         = "demo_output_interaction", 
                        fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis", "CD_dysbiosis", "UC_dysbiosis"), 
                        reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"))
```

### 4.2 Random Effects

Certain studies have a natural "grouping" of sample observations, such
as by subject in longitudinal designs or by family in family designs. It is 
important for statistic analysis to address the non-independence between samples
belonging to the same group MaAsLin 3 provides a simple interface for this
through the parameter `random_effects`, where the user can specify the grouping
variable to run a [mixed effect model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) instead. For
example, we note that HMP2 is a longitudinal design where the same subject 
(column `subject`) can have multiple samples. We thus ask MaAsLin 3 to use
subject as its random effect grouping variable:

```R
fit_data_random = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_data, 
                           input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                           min_prevalence = 0,
                           normalization  = "NONE",
                           output         = "demo_output_random", 
                           fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis"),
                           random_effects = c("subject"),
                           reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"))
```

If you are interested in testing the effect of time in a longitudinal study,
then the time point variable should be included in `fixed_effects` during your
MaAsLin 3 call.

* Question: intuitively, can you think of a reason why it is important to 
  address non-independence between samples?
  * Hint: imagine the simple scenario where you have two subject, one case and 
    one control, each has two samples.
  * What is the effective sample size, when samples of the same subject are 
    highly independent, versus when they are highly correlated?

### 4.3 Additional Options

MaAsLin 3 provide many parameter options for different data pre-processing (normalization,
filtering, transfomation) and other tasks. The full list of these options are:

* `min_abundance`
  * The minimum abundance for each feature [ Default: `0` ]
* `min_prevalence`
  * The minimum percent of samples for which a feature is detected at minimum 
  abundance [ Default: `0.1` ]
* `max_significance`
  * The q-value threshold for significance [ Default: `0.25` ]
* `normalization`
  * The normalization method to apply [ Default: `"TSS"` ]
        [ Choices: `"TSS"`, `"CLR"`, `"CSS"`, `"NONE"`, `"TMM"` ]
* `transform`
  * The transform to apply [ Default: `"LOG"` ]
        [ Choices: `"LOG"`, `"LOGIT"`, `"AST"`, `"NONE"` ]
* `analysis_method`
  * The analysis method to apply [ Default: `"LM"` ]
        [ Choices: `"LM"`, `"CPLM"`, `"ZICP"`, `"NEGBIN"`, `"ZINB"` ]
* `correction`
  * The correction method for computing the 
        q-value [ Default: `"BH"` ]
* `standardize`
  * Apply z-score so continuous metadata are 
        on the same scale [ Default: `TRUE` ]
* `plot_heatmap`
  * Generate a heatmap for the significant 
        associations [ Default: `TRUE` ]
* `heatmap_first_n`
  * In heatmap, plot top N features with significant 
        associations [ Default: `50` ]
* `plot_scatter`
  * Generate scatter plots for the significant
        associations [ Default: `TRUE` ]
* `cores`
  * The number of R processes to run in parallel
        [ Default: `1` ]
* `reference`
  * The factor to use as a reference for a variable with more than two levels provided as a string of 'variable,reference' semi-colon delimited for multiple variables.


#### 4.3.1 Prevalence and abundance filtering in MaAsLin 3

Typically, it only makes sense to test for feature-metadata associations if a feature is non-zero "enough" of the time. "Enough" can vary between studies, but a 10-50% minimum prevalence threshold is not unusual (and up to 70-90% can be reasonable). Since we're already using a small, selected subset of demo data, we'll use `min_prevalence = 0.1` to test only features with at least 10% non-zero values. **Note:** this is the default parameter setting in MaAsLin 3. 

Similarly, it's often desirable to test only features that reach a minimum abundance threshold in at least this many samples. By default, MaAsLin 3 will consider any non-zero value to be reliable, and if you've already done sufficient QC in your dataset, this is appropriate. However, if you'd like to filter more or be conservative, you can set a minimum abundance threshold like `min_abundance = 0.0001` to test only features reaching at least this (relative) abundance.

Putting these arguments together, we can run MaAsLin 3 (and it'll go even faster!) using both:

```R
fit_data_filter = Maaslin2(input_data     = df_input_data, 
                           input_metadata = df_input_metadata, 
                           normalization  = "NONE",
                           output         = "demo_output_filter", 
                           fixed_effects  = c("diagnosis", "dysbiosis"),
                           reference      = c("diagnosis,nonIBD"),
                           random_effects = c("subject"),
                           min_prevalence = 0.1,
                           min_abundance  = 0.0001)
```


## 5. Command Line Interface

MaAsLin 3 can also be run with a command line interface. For example, the demo
analysis can be performed with:

```
Maaslin2.R --transform=AST --fixed_effects="diagnosis,dysbiosis"  /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Maaslin2/extdata/HMP2_taxonomy.tsv /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/Maaslin2/extdata/HMP2_metadata.tsv demo_output --reference="diagnosis,nonIBD"
```

* Make sure to provide the full path to the MaAsLin 3 executable (ie ./R/Maaslin2.R).
* In the demo command:
    * ``HMP2_taxonomy.tsv`` is the path to your data (or features) file
    * ``HMP2_metadata.tsv`` is the path to your metadata file
    * ``demo_output`` is the path to the folder to write the output
